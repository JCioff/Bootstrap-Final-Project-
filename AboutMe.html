								<h3 class="mt-0">Hello There!</h3>Thanks for stopping by. As of right now I am currently a student at James Madison University nearing my fourth and final year of studying graphic design as well as some basic fundamentals of code. This site was created in order to effectively demonstrate some key components of the Bootstrap framework. I have worked tirelessly busting myself to make this website look pretty; in fact, it isn't the prettiest, but speaking of busting, meet Buster! He's one of the best good boys out there, and he is much, much more aesthetically pleasing than the entirety of this chunk of code. So if this website doesn't meet your expectations or excite you nearly half as much as good boys do, enjoy scrolling through the life of this chunky little happy fella <a class="stretched-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/busternbean/?igshid=1ah5v8vts1spn">(& Mr.Bean üê∂).</a>

				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>My name is Jake Cioffi, pronounced as in "chee-oh-fee". It's Italian, so it carries a hard "ch", yet 9/10 people still butcher it either way. I hail from the one & only concrete jungle, better known as "New Yawk". After my father met my mother and they were soon married, he couldn't help but always stress how he wanted his kids to "have grass in their backyard to grow up with". Lo & behold, they were married and would soon purchase their first house far out east in "Lawng Eyeland". If you couldn't pick up my accent by now, you must have been in quarantine all your life and not just a few months. Yes, I am a full-blooded eye-talian guinea and I'm proud.</p>

				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>I grew up in Long Island, New York and went to Chaminade High School, a private all-male Catholic prepatory school. Prior to high school, my interests in education and learning were apathetic. I was more interested in video games and playing outside. It wasn't until I got to high school that I would begin to take a serious interest in school and exploring more outside of just the classroom. This later allowed me to attend James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Here, I began exploring different career paths, and eventually I landed on interactive graphic design.</p>
			</div><!-- end section 2 -->
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3>Why This?</h3>
				<p>I come from a very Italian family. I am one of three, and I am an mirror-image identical twin. Both my twin and I were the first in our immediate family to attend college & receive a higher education as everyone else in our house jumped straight to working. Instead of joining the family business, we decided on going away. It wasn't until a few weeks had gone by after being at JMU on the quad that the heavens above had opened and a light shone down on Harrison Hall. From here, the rest was history. I have been designing content for the last two years since while studying graphic design. Originally a fan of being in front of the camera, I decided to take my talents behind one in order to explore the depth of my creative imagination.</p>
